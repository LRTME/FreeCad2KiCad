Dictionary type

Two keys with three sections:
- Footprints: 
	- added: []
	- changed: []
	- removed: []
- Drawings:
	- added: []
	- changed: []
	- removed: []
	
Empty list it None, so the check if there is any data is still valid 
	*if diff[key].get("removed"*

Make sure if all values are empty lists,
