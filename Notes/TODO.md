### Priority
- "Added" so that new one is redrawn and diff doesn't fall
- when adding an Arc to Sketch, Scanner recognises it as a circle.
- collision detection (KiCAD overrides FreeCAD with footprints, FC overrides drawings)?  Timestamp?

- handle sending PCB from KC to FC after connect/disconnect/connect (crash)


## Ideas
- add Part Object to plugin instance (if existing FC project is opened, no need for importing PCB again)
- script for installing plugins (creating symlinks...)
- Loading bar for adding elements to part...
