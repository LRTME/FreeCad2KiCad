### Priority
- DONE geometry not coincidented: modify function to contrain only specific geometries 
- DONE when adding an Arc to Sketch, Scanner recognises it as a circle. 

- collision detection (KiCAD overrides FreeCAD with footprints, FC overrides drawings)?  Timestamp?
- when changing fp model placement -> actually change fp parent placement
- handle sending PCB from KC to FC after connect/disconnect/connect (crash)


## Ideas
- add Part Object to plugin instance (if existing FC project is opened, no need for importing PCB again)
- script for installing plugins (creating symlinks...)
- Loading bar for adding elements to part...
