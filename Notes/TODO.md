### Priority
- connect/disconnect FC: handle when KC disconects properly
- when adding an Arc to Sketch, Scanner recognises it as a circle.
- Handle Diff Sync (see [[Diff Sync.canvas|Diff Sync]])      DONE for manual sync (buttons)
- README
- fc ->kc diff 3D models?
- add Part Object to plugin instance (if existing FC project is opened, no need for importing PCB again)
## Ideas
- script for installing plugins (creating symlinks...)
- Loading bar for adding elements to part...
