### Priority
- flatten "changes" entries in Diff in FC side (updateDiffDict)
- create a directory with common functions (updateDiffDict, dump to jsonfile)

- ##### Handle Diff Sync (see [[Diff Sync.canvas|Diff Sync]])
	- make sure pcb is updated when updating in FC
	-DONE make sure pcb is updated when updating in KC
	-DONE compare hash fc->kc
	- compare hash kc->fc


- fc ->kc diff 3D models?
## Ideas
- Loading bar for adding elements to part...
- script for installing plugins (creating symlinks...)
