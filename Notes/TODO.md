### Priority
- Make diffs a dictionary instead of list: {"rot": 90} insted ["rot", 90]
this would make it easier to override latest value of a changed property when reducing Diff dictionary

- Handle Diff Sync (see [[Diff Sync.canvas|Diff Sync]])
## Ideas
- Loading bar for adding elements to part...
